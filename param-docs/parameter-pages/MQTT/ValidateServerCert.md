# Parameter `ValidateServerCert`
Default Value: `true`

!!! Warning
    This is an **Expert Parameter**! Only change it if you understand what it does!

Enable or disable the validation of the server certificate.

If `enabled (true)`, the certificate sent by the server is validated using the configured [Root CA Certificate file](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Parameters/#parameter-cacert).\
The server name in [uri](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Parameters/#parameter-uri) is compared with the CN field of the server certificate. A connection will be only established if these match.\
It ensures the origin of the server.

If `disabled (false)`, only the validity of the certificate (e.g. expiry) is checked, not the origin (CN field).\
If you use public brokers, make sure to set this parameter to "enabled", to avoid potential MITM-Attacks!

!!! Note
    This also means that you might have to change the protocol and port in  to `mqtts://example.com:8883`!
